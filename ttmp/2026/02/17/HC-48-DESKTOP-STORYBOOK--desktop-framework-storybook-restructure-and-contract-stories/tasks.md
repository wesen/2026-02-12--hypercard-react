# Tasks

## TODO

- [x] G1: Define and enforce updated Storybook taxonomy for framework stories (`Engine/Shell`, `Engine/Widgets`, `Engine/PluginRuntime`) and keep app namespaces aligned to package/app directory structure
- [x] G2: Hard-cutover existing engine story titles to the new taxonomy without moving story files
- [x] G3: Add contract-focused desktop stories (contributions, adapter chain precedence, interaction density/perf harness) under the new framework namespaces
- [x] G4: Run taxonomy checks/tests and update HC-48 changelog + diary with implementation notes and commit references
