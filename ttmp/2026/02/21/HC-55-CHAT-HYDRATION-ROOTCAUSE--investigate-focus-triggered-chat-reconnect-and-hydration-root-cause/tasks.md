# Tasks

## TODO

- [ ] Add tasks here

- [ ] Trace why chat component remounts/reconnects when focusing window
- [ ] Instrument mount/unmount/connect/disconnect to isolate trigger path
- [ ] Decide long-term hydration policy (initial snapshot vs reconnect semantics)
- [ ] Add regression tests that fail on unintended reconnect/hydrate during focus
