# HyperCard React QOL Improvements Analysis

## Overview

This ticket contains a full implementation analysis for seven requested quality-of-life improvements in `2026-02-12--hypercard-react`:

1. Event viewer scroll-follow behavior
2. Event payload copy-to-clipboard
3. Cached tokens in chat footer
4. Multi-window behavior for same top-level icon/card
5. Double-emoji title cleanup
6. Replay of potentially buffered historical events
7. Conversation ID copy in chat header

The analysis is intentionally detailed so a new intern can implement with minimal additional discovery.
