# Redux rollout backlog and sequencing

This ticket executes the OS-16 migration plan. The rule for this rollout is:

- each widget is handled in a discrete task;
- each task includes the slice, story seeding, validation, and diary updates;
- each task should end in a commit before moving on.

## Status board

### Phase 1 — Durable widgets (`Redux now`)

- [x] `LogViewer`
- [ ] `MacCalc`
- [ ] `MacCalendar`
- [x] `KanbanBoard`
- [ ] `DeepResearch`
- [ ] `ChatBrowser`
- [ ] `GameFinder`
- [ ] `RetroMusicPlayer`
- [ ] `StreamLauncher`
- [ ] `SteamLauncher`
- [ ] `YouTubeRetro`
- [ ] `NodeEditor`
- [ ] `SystemModeler`

### Phase 2 — Partial slices later

- [ ] `GraphNavigator`
- [ ] `MacRepl`
- [ ] `LogicAnalyzer`
- [ ] `ControlRoom`

### Phase 3 — Keep local unless requirements change

- [ ] `ChartView`
- [ ] `MacWrite`
- [ ] `Oscilloscope`

## Execution notes

`LogViewer` is the first completed migration and establishes the execution pattern:

1. add a per-widget `app_rw_<widget>` state key;
2. create a serializable slice;
3. keep transient DOM-only behavior local;
4. seed deterministic Storybook states via Redux;
5. preserve non-Redux standalone usage when the widget is rendered outside launcher/store context.

The next implementation task is `DeepResearch`.
