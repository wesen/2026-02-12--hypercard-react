# MacSlides import diary

## 2026-03-06 — Ticket creation and initial audit

### Goal

Create a dedicated ticket for importing `imports/mac-slides.jsx` as a proper rich widget, then break the work into task-sized steps before starting implementation.

### Initial findings from `imports/mac-slides.jsx`

- The file is a monolith combining UI, styles, markdown parsing, slideshow handling, and fake desktop/window chrome.
- The import reimplements app shell elements that should not survive the port:
  - menu bar,
  - dropdown menus,
  - title bar,
  - close box,
  - desktop texture,
  - browser-global style injection.
- The actual reusable widget content is the presentation editor itself:
  - slide list,
  - markdown editor,
  - preview pane,
  - slideshow mode,
  - alignment control.
- The markdown rendering layer needs cleanup before adoption:
  - ad hoc HTML generation,
  - fake `oli` intermediate tags,
  - duplicated directive parsing paths,
  - inline `<style>` injection.

### Next step

Task 1: scaffold the widget folder and extract the reusable helper/domain layer before starting the big JSX/CSS rebuild.

## 2026-03-06 — Task 1 scaffold

### Goal

Create the initial `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/` folder and extract the raw import’s reusable domain/helpers before attempting the UI rewrite.

### Files added

- `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/types.ts`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/sampleData.ts`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/markdown.ts`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/MacSlides.tsx`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/markdown.test.ts`

### What changed

1. Added a typed deck model:
   - `SlideAlignment`
   - `SlideDocument`
   - `MacSlidesDeck`
2. Extracted the raw import’s core helper logic into `markdown.ts`:
   - slide splitting,
   - alignment directive parsing,
   - alignment class naming,
   - the initial markdown-to-HTML renderer.
3. Moved the demo deck into `sampleData.ts` and added helper variants for dense and empty decks.
4. Added a minimal `MacSlides.tsx` scaffold component so the folder has a real widget entrypoint while the full CSS/primitive rebuild is still pending.
5. Added tests around the extracted helper layer so the cleanup can proceed with a stable baseline.

### Notes

- This is intentionally not yet wired into `parts.ts`, `theme/index.ts`, package exports, or launcher modules.
- The markdown renderer is still intentionally simple; the goal of Task 1 was extraction and typing, not final rendering fidelity.

### Commands run

```bash
npm run test -w packages/rich-widgets
```

### Results

- `npm run test -w packages/rich-widgets` ✅

### Next task

Task 2: add `RICH_PARTS` entries and build `theme/mac-slides.css`, replacing the import’s inline style object and injected style blocks with repo-native CSS.

## 2026-03-06 — Task 2 parts and CSS contract

### Goal

Define the widget’s parts/CSS contract before the full JSX rebuild so the next implementation step can target stable `data-part` names instead of inventing them during the component rewrite.

### Files changed

- `packages/rich-widgets/src/parts.ts`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/theme/mac-slides.css`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/theme/index.ts`

### What changed

1. Added a `MacSlides` section to `RICH_PARTS` for the major widget regions:
   - root/body/sidebar/editor/preview,
   - slide thumbnail regions,
   - pane headers/meta,
   - preview frame/navigation row,
   - alignment toggle/deck stats,
   - presentation-mode frame/status.
2. Added `theme/mac-slides.css` with the initial CSS contract:
   - base widget layout,
   - sidebar/thumb layout,
   - editor/preview pane structure,
   - presentation-mode overlay/frame,
   - extracted `.slide-content` typography rules.
3. Imported the new CSS file from `packages/rich-widgets/src/theme/index.ts`.

### Notes

- This task intentionally defines the target CSS contract before the full widget rebuild.
- The current scaffold component does not yet consume all of these parts; that happens in Task 3.
- Remote font imports, desktop textures, and browser-global scrollbar hacks are still absent from the CSS on purpose and will not be reintroduced.

### Commands run

```bash
npm run test -w packages/rich-widgets
npm run storybook:check
```

### Results

- `npm run test -w packages/rich-widgets` ✅
- `npm run storybook:check` ✅

### Next task

Task 3: rebuild the widget layout against the new parts/CSS contract, remove the fake app chrome, and keep only the actual presentation editor functionality.

## 2026-03-06 — Task 3 widget rebuild

### Goal

Replace the placeholder component with the actual widget layout, mapped onto rich-widget primitives and the new `data-part` contract.

### Files changed

- `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/MacSlides.tsx`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/parts.ts`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/theme/mac-slides.css`

### What changed

1. Replaced the placeholder component with the real widget UI:
   - `WidgetToolbar`,
   - slide sidebar,
   - markdown editor pane,
   - preview pane,
   - `WidgetStatusBar`,
   - command palette,
   - presentation overlay.
2. Kept the actual presentation-editor behavior from the import while removing the fake shell:
   - no menu bar,
   - no fake title bar,
   - no desktop texture,
   - no global style injection,
   - no app-shell chrome copied into the widget.
3. Added small helper behavior needed for the cleaned port:
   - slide alignment cycling,
   - current-slide alignment rewriting,
   - keyboard shortcuts for palette/presentation/navigation.
4. Extended the CSS/parts contract to eliminate the remaining inline layout styling used during the first rebuild pass:
   - toolbar button sizing,
   - toolbar spacer,
   - thumbnail preview content wrapper.

### Notes

- State is still local at this point; Task 5 is where the Redux decision gets made.
- The widget is intentionally not yet exported or launcher-registered.
- Task 3 focused on getting the cleaned widget structure correct before Storybook and state wiring.

### Commands run

```bash
npm run test -w packages/rich-widgets
npm run storybook:check
```

### Results

- `npm run test -w packages/rich-widgets` ✅
- `npm run storybook:check` ✅

### Next task

Task 4: add Storybook stories for default, empty, dense, alignment, and presentation-focused states so the widget has a real scenario harness before launcher wiring.

## 2026-03-06 — Task 4 Storybook coverage

### Goal

Add scenario coverage for the cleaned widget before export/launcher wiring so the port has a review harness for layout and stateful UI states.

### Files changed

- `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/MacSlides.tsx`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/MacSlides.stories.tsx`

### What changed

1. Added seedable view props to `MacSlides`:
   - `initialSlide`
   - `initialShowPalette`
   - `initialShowPresentation`
2. Added Storybook stories covering the first review set:
   - default deck,
   - empty deck,
   - dense deck,
   - alignment-focused deck,
   - presentation-open state,
   - palette-open state.
3. Kept this task local-state friendly so the story harness could land before the Redux decision in Task 5.

### Notes

- The new seed props are deliberate: they let stories represent UI states cleanly and they remain useful even if Task 5 adds a Redux-backed path.
- The alignment story uses a targeted demo deck instead of overloading the main sample deck.

### Commands run

```bash
npm run test -w packages/rich-widgets
npm run storybook:check
```

### Results

- `npm run test -w packages/rich-widgets` ✅
- `npm run storybook:check` ✅

### Next task

Task 5: decide the state boundary, add the Redux-backed path if warranted, and wire package exports plus launcher integration.

## 2026-03-06 — Task 5 Redux boundary and launcher wiring

### Goal

Finish the import by deciding the durable state boundary, wiring the widget into the rich-widgets package surface, and making it launchable from the desktop module list.

### Files changed

- `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/macSlidesState.ts`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/macSlidesState.test.ts`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/MacSlides.tsx`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/mac-slides/MacSlides.stories.tsx`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/index.ts`
- `packages/rich-widgets/src/launcher/modules.tsx`
- `ttmp/2026/03/06/OS-18-MAC-SLIDES-IMPORT--macslides-rich-widget-import-and-cleanup/design/01-macslides-import-plan.md`

### State decision

I decided the widget does justify a Redux slice.

Why:

- the deck text and current slide are real widget-session state, not purely local rendering details;
- palette/presentation visibility are part of the behavior we want Storybook and launcher-backed windows to reproduce deterministically;
- the repo’s current cleanup direction is to move meaningful widget state into Redux where it improves seeded scenarios and desktop integration.

What stays local:

- textarea refs and cursor manipulation,
- DOM event handlers inside presentation mode,
- transient browser focus mechanics.

### What changed

1. Added `macSlidesState.ts` with a dedicated `app_rw_mac_slides` slice for:
   - markdown content,
   - current slide,
   - palette-open state,
   - presentation-open state.
2. Added reducer tests covering seed normalization and state replacement/update behavior.
3. Reworked `MacSlides.tsx` into the same connected/standalone pattern used by other migrated widgets:
   - Redux-backed path when the slice is registered,
   - local reducer fallback when used standalone.
4. Updated the Storybook stories so stateful scenarios can use the seeded store helper instead of only prop seeding.
5. Exported the widget and slice helpers from `packages/rich-widgets/src/index.ts`.
6. Registered the widget in `packages/rich-widgets/src/launcher/modules.tsx` so it can launch as a desktop rich widget.
7. Updated the implementation plan doc to record the final state-boundary decision instead of the earlier tentative note.

### Commands run

```bash
npm run test -w packages/rich-widgets
npm run storybook:check
npm run typecheck -w packages/rich-widgets
```

### Results

- `npm run test -w packages/rich-widgets` ✅
- `npm run storybook:check` ✅
- `npm run typecheck -w packages/rich-widgets` ⚠️ fails on the pre-existing `packages/rich-widgets` project `rootDir` / file-list configuration and unrelated baseline errors in `packages/engine` and `src/oscilloscope`, not on `MacSlides`

### Ticket status

- All planned import tasks are now complete.

## 2026-03-06 — Ticket validation and reMarkable upload

### Goal

Close the ticket cleanly by verifying doc hygiene and publishing the finished bundle for offline review.
