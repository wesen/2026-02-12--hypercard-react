# Implementation Diary

## 2026-03-02 — MacCalc spreadsheet widget port

### What was done

Full port of `maccalc.jsx` → `MacCalc.tsx`. A spreadsheet/calculator with:
- 50-row x 26-column grid with scrollable viewport, sticky row/column headers
- Formula engine supporting SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT, ABS, SQRT, ROUND, POWER, IF, CONCAT
- Cell formatting: bold, italic, alignment (left/center/right), number formats (plain/number/currency/percent)
- Cell selection via click, drag selection for ranges, Shift+click range select
- Column resize via drag handles
- Formula bar showing raw formula for selected cell
- Find & Replace with match highlighting
- Command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) with 25 actions across format/edit/function/view/file categories
- Keyboard navigation (arrows, Tab, Enter, F2 to edit, Delete to clear)
- Status bar with range statistics (SUM, AVG, COUNT) when range selected
- CSV export to clipboard

**Files created:**
- `calculator/types.ts` — CellData, CellFormat, CellAlign, CellRange, constants, utility functions
- `calculator/formula.ts` — evaluateFormula engine with all spreadsheet functions
- `calculator/sampleData.ts` — Quarterly financial summary (Revenue/Expenses/Profit/Margin), CALC_ACTIONS
- `calculator/MacCalc.tsx` — Main component + Palette + FindBar sub-components (~600 lines)
- `calculator/MacCalc.stories.tsx` — Default, Empty, Compact stories
- `theme/calculator.css` — 27 data-part rules for grid, cells, headers, palette, find bar

**Key decisions:**
- Split formula engine into its own file (`formula.ts`) since it's pure logic and testable in isolation
- Dropped internal themes (classic/dark/green) — engine handles theming
- Removed window chrome/title bar
- Replaced TBtn custom toolbar button with `Btn` from engine
- Used `data-state` for cell states: "selected", "in-range", "match" instead of inline styles

### Verification

All 3 Storybook stories render correctly. Formulas calculate (SUM=5,630, Margin=33.3%-40.6%). Grid scrolls with sticky headers. Controls panel shows initialCells prop.

## 2026-03-02 — GraphNavigator widget port

### What was done

Full port of `graph-navigator.jsx` → `GraphNavigator.tsx`. A graph database explorer with:
- 3-column layout: Node Browser (left), Graph View + Query Console (center), Inspector + Edge Types (right)
- Force-directed graph layout via custom `useForceGraph` hook (repulsion, spring attraction, gravity, damping)
- Canvas-based rendering with DPR-aware scaling, grid background, directed edges with arrows, emoji-labeled nodes
- Node drag support + background panning
- Node Browser sidebar with type filter buttons (All/Person/Company/Project)
- Query Console with Cypher-like syntax parsing (type=, label=, MATCH...RETURN)
- Node Inspector showing properties and clickable relationships
- Edge Types panel with sorted counts

**Files created:**
- `graph-navigator/types.ts` — GraphNavNode, GraphNavEdge, NodeTypeStyle, TYPE_STYLES
- `graph-navigator/sampleData.ts` — 12 sample nodes, 19 edges, NODE_FILTER_TYPES
- `graph-navigator/GraphNavigator.tsx` — Main component + useForceGraph hook + GraphCanvas sub-component (~500 lines)
- `graph-navigator/GraphNavigator.stories.tsx` — Default, Compact, Empty, PersonsOnly stories
- `theme/graph-navigator.css` — 27 data-part rules for 3-column layout, panels, node list, console, inspector

**Key decisions:**
- Kept canvas-based graph rendering (force simulation needs per-frame updates)
- Used `useRef` for position/velocity state to avoid re-render on every animation frame, with periodic `setPositions` for canvas redraw
- Removed window chrome (shell handles it)
- Replaced MacButton with `Btn` from engine
- All CSS uses `--hc-*` tokens, no hardcoded colors

### Verification

All 4 Storybook stories render correctly. Force-directed graph animates nodes into position. Node clicking selects and highlights connected edges. Query console accepts type/label/MATCH queries. Inspector shows properties and navigable relationships.

### Lessons learned

- Force simulation state (positions, velocities) must live in refs, not React state, to avoid thousands of re-renders per second
- Canvas DPR handling: set `canvas.width = width * dpr`, then `ctx.setTransform(dpr, 0, 0, dpr, 0, 0)` for crisp rendering
- The `useForceGraph` hook pattern (refs + RAF loop + periodic state sync) is reusable for any physics simulation

## 2026-03-02 — MacCalendar widget port

### What was done

Full port of `maccal.jsx` → `MacCalendar.tsx`. This is a substantial widget with:
- Month view with full 6-week grid, event chips, day-click to create
- Week view with hourly time grid, positioned events, "now" line indicator
- Event modal for create/edit/delete with date, time, duration, color pickers
- Command palette (⌘P) with search, keyboard navigation
- Keyboard shortcuts (N=new, T=today, M/W=view toggle, ←→=navigate)
- Status bar with event counts and shortcut hints

**Files created:**
- `calendar/types.ts` — CalendarEvent, CalendarView, utility functions (sameDay, fmtTime, mkEventId)
- `calendar/sampleData.ts` — 8 initial events, EVENT_COLORS using CSS tokens, makePaletteActions
- `calendar/MacCalendar.tsx` — Main component + MonthView, WeekView, EventModal, Palette sub-components
- `calendar/MacCalendar.stories.tsx` — Default, WeekView, Empty, EmptyWeek, Compact stories
- `theme/calendar.css` — 35+ data-part rules

**Key decisions:**
- Dropped the original's 3 internal themes (classic/dark/green) — the engine's theming system handles that. The widget now uses CSS tokens exclusively.
- Removed window chrome/title bar (shell handles it)
- Replaced MacButton with `Btn` from engine
- Used `Btn` with `data-state="active"` for duration selector and color picker instead of custom styled divs
- Kept event colors as a prop (`eventColors`) defaulting to CSS token-based grays — theme can override

### Verification

All 5 Storybook stories render. Month view shows March 2026 grid with events properly placed. Controls panel in Storybook shows initialEvents, initialView (radio month/week), eventColors props.

### Lessons learned

- Calendar widgets are dense — many sub-components (month grid, week grid, event modal, palette) each need their own data-parts
- The original's inline theme system (`THEMES.classic`, `THEMES.dark`, `THEMES.green`) is replaced wholesale by the engine's CSS tokens — much cleaner
- Week view needs `position: relative` + absolute event positioning — keep structural CSS tight

## 2026-03-02 — LogicAnalyzer widget completion

### What was done

The LogicAnalyzer widget was partially ported (component + types + stories existed) but had several gaps preventing it from compiling and rendering properly. Fixed:

1. **Added LA parts to `parts.ts`** — The component referenced `RICH_PARTS.logicAnalyzer`, `RICH_PARTS.laMain`, `RICH_PARTS.laBezel`, etc. but these constants didn't exist. Added 16 part constants (logicAnalyzer, laMain, laDisplay, laBezel, laBezelReflection, laDisplayStatus, laControls, laControlGroup, laControlGroupTitle, laChannelRow, laChannelColor, laSlider, laSliderLabel, laSliderValue, laToolbar, laSeparator).

2. **Fleshed out CSS** — The existing `logic-analyzer.css` was structurally correct but missing:
   - Inset box-shadows on `la-control-group` (the classic Mac 3D effect: `inset -1px -1px 0 #fff, inset 1px 1px 0 #808080`)
   - Bezel `padding: 3px` (matching oscilloscope)
   - Status bar 3D border (`border-top-color` for the emboss effect)
   - CRT reflection overlay CSS rule for `la-bezel-reflection`

3. **Added CRT glass reflection** — Added `<div data-part="la-bezel-reflection" />` inside the bezel, with CSS providing the diagonal gradient overlay (matching the original import's glass effect).

4. **Registered exports** — Added LogicAnalyzer + types to `index.ts`, added CSS import to `theme/index.ts`.

5. **Fixed type errors** — The `Checkbox` engine component has `onChange: () => void` but the code was passing `Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>` (the raw state setter). Wrapped with `() => setState(v => !v)` for proper toggle behavior.

### What was tricky

- **Checkbox onChange type mismatch**: The engine's `Checkbox` component takes `onChange: () => void` (a toggle callback) but the natural pattern is to pass `setFoo` from `useState`. The oscilloscope has the same bug (passes state setter directly) — it just isn't caught because the tsconfig cross-package check has pre-existing `rootDir` errors that mask it. Worth noting for future cleanup.

- **tsconfig cross-package errors**: Running `tsc --noEmit --project packages/rich-widgets/tsconfig.json` produces many `rootDir`/`TS6059` errors from the engine package being pulled in. This is a pre-existing issue — the rich-widgets tsconfig resolves `@hypercard/engine` by following the source, which brings files outside its rootDir. Our logic-analyzer changes are clean; only filtered output was used to verify.

### Verification

- Storybook renders all 5 stories (Default, Paused, AllChannels, TwoChannels, Compact)
- Signal traces animate on the dark CRT canvas with proper colors
- Control panel: channels with color swatches, timing sliders, trigger buttons, protocol decode, display checkboxes all render correctly
- Bottom toolbar with Stop/Reset/Defaults and quick-access checkboxes works
- No JS console errors

### Lessons learned

- Always check `parts.ts` registration when porting a new widget — the component compiles against `RICH_PARTS.*` constants that must be defined
- The engine `Checkbox.onChange` is `() => void` (a toggle), not `(checked: boolean) => void` — wrap state setters accordingly
- Compare original import's inline `boxShadow` values carefully — the classic Mac inset effect is `inset -1px -1px 0 #fff, inset 1px 1px 0 #808080`
