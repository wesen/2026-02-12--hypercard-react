# Diary

## Goal

Track the step-by-step process of importing and integrating 17 rich macOS-style widgets into the go-go-os frontend framework. Capture decisions, failures, tricky bits, and reusable patterns to feed into the Widget Porting Playbook.

## Step 1: Codebase Analysis and Ticket Setup

Initial exploration phase: understand the imported widgets, the engine's widget system, and plan the integration.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Create a new ticket OS-07-ADD-RICH-WIDGETS to import many new rich widgets into the frontend collection. Make a new package that contains rich widgets. Start with @imports/log-viewer.jsx and analyze the structure and the goal is to match it to the style and reuse widgets from this repo and basically integrate this external sketch / react widgets, integrate it into this, with redux. Write copious storybook stories to test it (run storybook in tmux). First, create a detailed analysis of the imported react and how to map things to which widgets, add the document to the ticket and upload to remarkable. Then create tasks to integrate the widget, and work task by task, committing as you go, keeping a frequent diary."

**Assistant interpretation:** Create a docmgr ticket, analyze all 17 imported JSX files, map their inline-styled components to engine equivalents, plan a new `packages/rich-widgets` package, write an analysis doc, create implementation tasks, and begin porting starting with log-viewer.

**Inferred user intent:** Build a repeatable process for integrating external React sketches into the themed widget framework, starting with a thorough analysis and proceeding incrementally with documentation.

### What I did

1. Explored the full project structure: `packages/engine`, `packages/desktop-os`, `apps/`, `imports/`
2. Read all 17 imported JSX files (11,057 lines total) to understand their structure
3. Read the engine's widget system: `parts.ts` (104 data-parts), `index.ts` (35+ widgets), `theming-and-widget-playbook.md`
4. Read the engine's CSS system: tokens, primitives, shell, theme overrides
5. Read the desktop-os store: `createLauncherStore.ts`, `appManifest.ts`
6. Read Storybook config: `.storybook/main.ts`, `.storybook/preview.ts`
7. Read existing widget implementations: `Btn.tsx`, `Checkbox.tsx`, `DataTable.tsx`, `ListView.tsx`, `TabControl.tsx`, `SelectableList.tsx`
8. Created docmgr ticket OS-07-ADD-RICH-WIDGETS with design doc, diary, and playbook
9. Wrote comprehensive analysis document mapping all imports to engine widgets
10. Created 24-task implementation plan across 7 phases

### Why

Need a clear map from imported inline-styled components to engine's data-part/token system before writing any code. The imports duplicate UI primitives extensively — understanding exactly what maps where prevents redundant work.

### What worked

- The theming-and-widget-playbook.md is exceptionally detailed and gave clear patterns for widget creation
- The `parts.ts` file makes it easy to see what data-parts already exist
- The engine widget index shows exactly what's available for composition

### What didn't work

- Initial directory exploration was misleading — `ls` on `desktop-os/src/` showed subdirectories that didn't exist (the `ls` output was from a different checkout state)
- Had to use `find` to get the actual file listing

### What I learned

**Key insight for playbook:** Before porting any widget, build a **primitive mapping table** that maps every inline-styled element in the import to either (a) an existing engine widget, (b) a CSS data-part that handles it, or (c) a "NEW" marker indicating a primitive that needs to be created. This table is the single most important artifact for planning the port.

**Pattern discovered across all 17 imports:**
- Every import reimplements: button, checkbox, window/titlebar, status bar
- Many reimplement: slider, radio button, search input, tooltip
- The reimplementations vary slightly (different padding, border-radius, shadow values) but are functionally identical
- The engine already has 80% of these primitives

**Architecture patterns in the imports:**
- All use `useState` for local state — no global state management
- Canvas-based widgets (oscilloscope, charts, logic-analyzer) use `useRef` + `requestAnimationFrame`
- Several implement their own drag handling (mactask, node-editor) — could share a `useDrag` hook
- Several implement their own keyboard navigation — could share patterns with engine's existing keyboard handling

### What was tricky to build

Nothing built yet — this was analysis only. The tricky part was understanding the full scope: 17 files, 11K lines, spread across multiple UI categories. The key challenge was systematically mapping each import's local primitives to engine equivalents without getting lost in the details.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- The decision to create a new `packages/rich-widgets` vs. adding to `packages/engine` — the boundary is "primitives vs. composites" but some new primitives (Sparkline, Slider) will live in the new package
- Whether canvas-based widgets should stay canvas or move to SVG for theme compatibility

### What should be done in the future

- Start Phase 1: create the package scaffolding
- Port LogViewer as reference implementation
- Extract reusable patterns into the playbook after the first widget is done

## Step 8: DeepResearch Widget Port (Phase 13)

### What was done
Ported `imports/deep-research-mac.jsx` (889 lines) → `packages/rich-widgets/src/deep-research/DeepResearch.tsx`.

**Files created:**
- `deep-research/types.ts` — ResearchStep union type (status | source | thinking | done), DepthLevel, DEPTH_LEVELS
- `deep-research/sampleData.ts` — DEMO_STEPS (14 research steps simulating a flow), generateReport()
- `deep-research/DeepResearch.tsx` — Main component + SourceCard + ProgressBar sub-components
- `deep-research/DeepResearch.stories.tsx` — 3 stories (Default, WithResults, Compact)
- `theme/deep-research.css` — 25 data-part rules, barberpole + blink animations

**Features:** Query input, depth selector (radio buttons), options (Checkbox from engine), research simulation with timed step progression, barberpole progress bar, source cards with index badges, thinking steps, final report display.

### Key decisions
- Radio buttons kept as custom elements (no engine Radio primitive) using `dr-radio` + `dr-radio-dot` data-parts
- Used engine `Checkbox` with `onChange={() => setState(v => !v)}` toggle pattern (lesson from LogicAnalyzer)
- Removed window chrome and internal themes — shell handles those
- Research simulation uses `setTimeout` chain to progressively reveal demo steps

### Verification
- TypeScript: clean (`pnpm tsc --noEmit`)
- Storybook: all 3 stories render correctly on port 6007
- Screenshot captured and verified

### Lessons learned
- The ResearchStep union type with discriminated `type` field makes step rendering clean via switch/case
- Barberpole progress bar animation reuses the same technique from the indeterminate progress pattern

## Step 10: RetroMusicPlayer Widget Port (Phase 15)

### What was done
Ported `imports/spotify-retro.jsx` (623 lines) → `packages/rich-widgets/src/music-player/RetroMusicPlayer.tsx`.

**Files created:**
- `music-player/types.ts` — Playlist, AlbumMeta, Track, ViewMode, parseDuration, fmtTime
- `music-player/sampleData.ts` — PLAYLISTS (10), ALBUMS, TRACKS_DB (4 playlists with specific tracks), getTracksForPlaylist()
- `music-player/RetroMusicPlayer.tsx` — Main component + EqViz + Marquee sub-components
- `music-player/RetroMusicPlayer.stories.tsx` — 3 stories (Default, Compact, FewPlaylists)
- `theme/music-player.css` — ~60 data-part rules, marquee animation, striped progress bar

**Features:** Now-playing bar with album art, transport controls (shuffle/prev/play/next/repeat), progress bar with seek, volume slider, EQ visualizer, marquee ticker, playlist sidebar, toolbar with play all/shuffle/grid toggle/EQ toggle/queue toggle, playlist header, track list (list/grid views), like toggle, queue panel, search, status bar, auto-advance with repeat support.

### Key decisions
- Removed menu bar, window chrome, desktop background, about dialog
- Moved menu actions to toolbar buttons (Grid/List toggle, EQ, Queue)
- Used `Btn` from engine for all buttons
- EQ visualizer kept as animated bar chart with CSS transitions
- Marquee uses CSS animation (`mp-marquee-scroll`)
- Progress bar uses repeating-linear-gradient for striped fill (matching retro style)

### Verification
- TypeScript: clean
- Storybook: all 3 stories render correctly on port 6007

## Step 9: GameFinder Widget Port (Phase 14)

### What was done
Ported `imports/gamefinder.jsx` (612 lines) → `packages/rich-widgets/src/game-finder/GameFinder.tsx`.

**Files created:**
- `game-finder/types.ts` — Game, Achievement, ArtType, GameFilter, GameSort, FILTER_OPTIONS, SORT_OPTIONS
- `game-finder/sampleData.ts` — SAMPLE_GAMES (8 classic Mac games with achievements)
- `game-finder/gameArt.ts` — drawGameArt() canvas-based pixel art for 8 game types
- `game-finder/GameFinder.tsx` — Main component + GameArt + StarRating + DownloadBar + GameDetail + GameRow
- `game-finder/GameFinder.stories.tsx` — 3 stories (Default, Compact, FewGames)
- `theme/game-finder.css` — ~60 data-part rules, launch animation

**Features:** Sidebar with navigation/filter/sort/profile stats, game list with canvas art thumbnails, detail view with hero, description, stats, achievements with progress, install/download simulation, launch overlay with progress animation, search.

### Key decisions
- Canvas pixel art kept as separate `gameArt.ts` utility for reuse
- Removed window chrome (MacWindow), menu bar, desktop background
- Used `Btn` from engine for Play/Back/Install buttons
- Radio buttons for sort kept as custom elements (same as DeepResearch)

### Verification
- TypeScript: clean
- Storybook: all 3 stories render correctly on port 6007
- Detail view verified by clicking Dark Castle — shows hero, achievements, stats

### Lessons learned
- Unicode escapes (`\u00B7`) in JSX text content render literally — must wrap in `{'\u00B7'}` expressions. This applies to all JSX text content between tags, NOT to string literals in `{}` expressions or JSX attributes.

### Code review instructions

- Review the analysis doc for completeness: `ttmp/.../design-doc/01-rich-widget-import-analysis-and-integration-plan.md`
- Verify the primitive mapping table accurately reflects engine capabilities
- Check that the task breakdown is reasonable and ordered correctly

### Technical details

**Engine widget count:** 35+ exported components from `packages/engine/src/components/widgets/index.ts`
**Engine data-parts:** 104 constants in `packages/engine/src/parts.ts`
**Engine themes:** base (default), classic, modern, macos1
**Import total:** 17 files, 11,057 lines
**Storybook:** Storybook 10.x with react-vite, configured at `.storybook/main.ts`
**Package manager:** pnpm with workspace protocol

## Step 11: StreamLauncher Widget Port (Phase 16)

### What was done
Ported `imports/stream-launcher.jsx` (442 lines) → `packages/rich-widgets/src/stream-launcher/StreamLauncher.tsx`.

**Files created:**
- `stream-launcher/types.ts` — Stream, StreamStatus, ThumbType, ChatMessage, StreamSort, CATEGORIES, SORT_OPTIONS
- `stream-launcher/sampleData.ts` — STREAMS (12 streams across 7 categories), CHAT_MESSAGES (8 messages)
- `stream-launcher/streamArt.ts` — drawStreamThumb() canvas-based monochrome thumbnails for 12 stream types with play overlay
- `stream-launcher/StreamLauncher.tsx` — Main component + StreamThumb + StreamCard + PlayerView sub-components
- `stream-launcher/StreamLauncher.stories.tsx` — 3 stories (Default, Compact, FewStreams)
- `theme/stream-launcher.css` — ~65 data-part rules for sidebar, search, stream cards, player, controls, chat

**Features:** Category sidebar with filter/sort, stream list with LIVE/VOD/OFFLINE badges, canvas thumbnails, player view with transport controls/volume/progress/chat panel, search, status bar.

### Key decisions
- Canvas thumbnails in separate `streamArt.ts` utility (same pattern as GameFinder)
- 12 distinct monochrome thumbnail types matching retro Mac aesthetic
- Chat panel renders inside the player view with message input

### Error encountered
Initially used wrong import `@anthropic/hypercard-engine` instead of `@hypercard/engine`. Found via Storybook build error. Fixed by grepping existing widgets to confirm the correct import path.

### Verification
- TypeScript: clean
- Storybook: all 3 stories render correctly, player view verified by clicking a stream

## Step 12: SteamLauncher Widget Port (Phase 17)

### What was done
Ported `imports/steam-launcher.jsx` (690 lines) → `packages/rich-widgets/src/steam-launcher/SteamLauncher.tsx`.

**Files created:**
- `steam-launcher/types.ts` — SteamGame, Friend, FriendStatus, SteamTab, GameFilter, TABS
- `steam-launcher/sampleData.ts` — GAMES (12 games), FRIENDS (7 friends)
- `steam-launcher/SteamLauncher.tsx` — Main component + TabBar + GameRow + GameDetail + FriendRow + FriendsList + StoreTab + CommunityTab + DownloadsTab
- `steam-launcher/SteamLauncher.stories.tsx` — 3 stories (Default, Compact, FewGames)
- `theme/steam-launcher.css` — ~70 data-part rules including `@keyframes st-marquee` for launch animation

**Features:** Tab navigation (Library/Store/Community/Downloads), game list sidebar with search, game detail with play/install/properties, friends list with online/away/offline groups, store tab with sale cards, launch dialog with progress animation, status bar.

### Key decisions
- Largest import at 690 lines — kept all sub-components in single file for cohesion
- Launch animation uses CSS `@keyframes st-marquee` for progress bar
- Friends grouped by status (online/away/offline) with counts

### Verification
- TypeScript: clean
- Storybook: all 3 stories render correctly, detail view and friends list verified

## Step 13: YouTubeRetro Widget Port (Phase 18)

### What was done
Ported `imports/youtube-retro.jsx` (579 lines) → `packages/rich-widgets/src/youtube-retro/YouTubeRetro.tsx`.

**Files created:**
- `youtube-retro/types.ts` — YtChannel, YtVideo, YtComment, YtCategory, YtView, CATEGORIES, parseDuration(), fmtTime()
- `youtube-retro/sampleData.ts` — CHANNELS (6), VIDEOS (12), COMMENTS (6)
- `youtube-retro/YouTubeRetro.tsx` — Main component + VideoPlayer + VideoCard + CommentItem sub-components
- `youtube-retro/YouTubeRetro.stories.tsx` — 3 stories (Default, Compact, FewVideos)
- `theme/youtube-retro.css` — ~85 data-part rules including CRT scanlines, moving scanline, vignette, buffer/progress bars

**Features:** Home view (video grid + category filter + subscriptions sidebar), watch view (CRT player with scanlines/vignette, transport controls, video info, like/share/save/report, channel subscribe, description, comments with add/list, related videos sidebar), search, status bar.

### Key decisions
- CRT effects (scanlines, moving scanline, vignette) all CSS-based using pseudo-elements and gradients
- `parseDuration()` and `fmtTime()` helpers in types.ts for consistent time display
- Related videos computed via `useMemo` filtering by same channel/category

### Verification
- TypeScript: clean
- Storybook: all 3 stories render correctly, home view with 12 videos, subscriptions, categories verified

## Summary: All 17 Widget Imports Ported

With StreamLauncher, SteamLauncher, and YouTubeRetro complete, all 17 imported JSX files have been ported to TypeScript widgets in `packages/rich-widgets`. The full roster:

| # | Widget | Source Lines | Phase |
|---|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Sparkline | primitive | 1 |
| 2 | LogViewer | 850 | 2 |
| 3 | ChartView | 476 | 3 |
| 4 | MacWrite | 730 | 4 |
| 5 | KanbanBoard | 780 | 5 |
| 6 | MacRepl | 505 | 6 |
| 7 | NodeEditor | 800 | 7 |
| 8 | Oscilloscope | 453 | 8 |
| 9 | LogicAnalyzer | 620 | 9 |
| 10 | MacCalendar | 858 | 10 |
| 11 | GraphNavigator | 680 | 11 |
| 12 | MacCalc | 900 | 12 |
| 13 | DeepResearch | 889 | 13 |
| 14 | GameFinder | 612 | 14 |
| 15 | RetroMusicPlayer | 623 | 15 |
| 16 | StreamLauncher | 442 | 16 |
| 17 | SteamLauncher | 690 | 17 |
| 18 | YouTubeRetro | 579 | 18 |

**Total lines ported:** ~11,000+ JSX → ~3,850 new lines (this commit) + previous commits.

**Remaining tasks:** Task 23 (register as launchable apps) and Task 24 (integration testing).

## Step 14: Desktop Integration Bugfixes

### What was done
1. **Fixed icon double-click not opening windows** — The DesktopShell integration story had desktop icons but no `DesktopCommandHandler` contributions to handle `icon.open.*` commands. Added command handlers for all widgets with `priority: 200` that dispatch `openWindow` with correct payloads.
2. **Fixed ChartView crashing without props** — `ChartView` required a `data` prop but was rendered as `<ChartView />` from the desktop story. Added default `SAMPLE_DATASETS['Quarterly Revenue']` fallback.

### Verification
- Storybook: All widgets open correctly on icon double-click, 0 errors
- TypeScript: clean

## Step 15: ChatBrowser Widget Port

### What was done
Ported `imports/mac-chat-browser.jsx` (629 lines) → `packages/rich-widgets/src/chat-browser/ChatBrowser.tsx`.

**Files created:**
- `chat-browser/types.ts` — Conversation, ChatMessage, SearchParams, EMPTY_SEARCH
- `chat-browser/sampleData.ts` — CONVERSATIONS (10 conversations), getAllTags(), getAllModels()
- `chat-browser/ChatBrowser.tsx` — Main component + ConvoRow + MessageBubble + SearchPanel
- `chat-browser/ChatBrowser.stories.tsx` — 3 stories (Default, Compact, FewConversations)
- `theme/chat-browser.css` — 33 data-part rules

**Features:** Conversation sidebar with quick filter, conversation viewer with user/assistant message bubbles and pre-wrapped text, advanced search panel with text/model/tag/date filters, engine Btn and Checkbox integration.

### Key decisions
- Removed window chrome (DraggableWindow, MacScrollbar, about dialog, menu bar, desktop)
- Collapsed the three-window layout (browser, viewer, search) into a single panel: sidebar + main area
- Search panel toggles in place of the conversation viewer (not a separate window)
- Used engine `Btn` (children pattern, `active` prop) and `Checkbox` (label/checked/onChange)

### Verification
- TypeScript: clean
- Storybook: all 3 stories render correctly, conversation selection and viewer verified
- Registered in launcher modules and desktop integration story

## Step 16: SystemModeler Widget Port

**Source:** `imports/system-modeler.jsx` (717 lines)
**Widget:** Simulink-style block diagram modeler

### What happened
Ported as `SystemModeler` widget — a visual block diagram modeling tool with SVG canvas.

### Files created
- `system-modeler/types.ts` — BlockTypeDef, BlockInstance, Wire, DragState, WiringState, Point; 14 BLOCK_TYPES with categories
- `system-modeler/sampleData.ts` — INITIAL_BLOCKS (Sine Wave → Gain → Scope), INITIAL_WIRES (2 connections)
- `system-modeler/SystemModeler.tsx` — Main component with SVG rendering (SvgBlock, SvgPort, SvgWire), block palette, simulation progress, parameter dialogs
- `system-modeler/SystemModeler.stories.tsx` — 3 stories (Default, Compact, EmptyCanvas)
- `theme/system-modeler.css` — 27 data-part CSS rules

**Features:** SVG canvas with draggable blocks + bezier wire connections, port-to-port wiring by click-drag, block palette sidebar with 3 categories (Sources, Math Operations, Routing & Sinks), simulation runner with progress bar, block parameter dialogs (Gain, Source amplitude/frequency, Constant value, Delay time), Delete/Backspace block removal, wire click-to-delete.

### Key decisions
- Stripped window chrome, menu bar, desktop, and about dialog
- Kept all 14 block types with proper SVG rendering (title bar + emoji + ports)
- Simulation is cosmetic (progress bar animation only)
- Block palette is a toggleable sidebar panel instead of a separate window

### Verification
- TypeScript: no new errors (all pre-existing)
- Storybook: 3 stories render, blocks visible, palette categories correct
- Registered in launcher modules (order 118) and desktop integration story

---

## Step 17: ControlRoom Dashboard Port

**Source:** `imports/control-room(1).jsx` (349 lines)
**Widget:** Industrial control room dashboard with 9 instrument panels

### What happened
Ported as a single `ControlRoom` widget. The original has 9 Mac-style window panels with various instrument components. All instrument sub-components are reusable and exported.

### Files created
- `control-room/types.ts` — LogLine, SwitchState, SwitchKey, clamp()
- `control-room/instruments.tsx` — 9 reusable instrument components: AnalogGauge (canvas), BarMeter, HorizontalBar, LED, ToggleSwitch, SevenSeg, Knob (drag), ScrollLog, Scope (canvas)
- `control-room/ControlRoom.tsx` — Main dashboard composing all instruments into 9 Panel sections with live simulated data
- `control-room/ControlRoom.stories.tsx` — 3 stories (Default, Compact, FastTick)
- `theme/control-room.css` — 57 data-part CSS rules (Win95-style bevel borders)

**Features:** Live-updating analog gauges with canvas needle rendering, vertical bar meters with danger thresholds, horizontal progress bars with hatched fill, LED indicators with glow effect, toggle switches with thumb animation, seven-segment LED displays (green-on-black), rotary knobs with mouse drag, auto-scrolling event log, oscilloscope trace with canvas rendering, configurable tick interval.

### Key decisions
- Ported as one widget (not 9 separate ones) since the dashboard is the product
- All instrument components are exported from index.ts for reuse
- Win95/System 7 bevel styling preserved via CSS data-part attributes
- Panel component replaces the original MacWindow wrapper (simpler, themeable)

### Verification
- TypeScript: no new errors
- Storybook: all 3 stories render, gauges animate, data updates live
- Registered in launcher modules (order 119) and desktop integration story
- Total: now 20 widgets in packages/rich-widgets
