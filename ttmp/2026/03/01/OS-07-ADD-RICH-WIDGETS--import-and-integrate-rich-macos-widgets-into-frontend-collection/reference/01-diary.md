# Diary

## Goal

Track the step-by-step process of importing and integrating 17 rich macOS-style widgets into the go-go-os frontend framework. Capture decisions, failures, tricky bits, and reusable patterns to feed into the Widget Porting Playbook.

## Step 1: Codebase Analysis and Ticket Setup

Initial exploration phase: understand the imported widgets, the engine's widget system, and plan the integration.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Create a new ticket OS-07-ADD-RICH-WIDGETS to import many new rich widgets into the frontend collection. Make a new package that contains rich widgets. Start with @imports/log-viewer.jsx and analyze the structure and the goal is to match it to the style and reuse widgets from this repo and basically integrate this external sketch / react widgets, integrate it into this, with redux. Write copious storybook stories to test it (run storybook in tmux). First, create a detailed analysis of the imported react and how to map things to which widgets, add the document to the ticket and upload to remarkable. Then create tasks to integrate the widget, and work task by task, committing as you go, keeping a frequent diary."

**Assistant interpretation:** Create a docmgr ticket, analyze all 17 imported JSX files, map their inline-styled components to engine equivalents, plan a new `packages/rich-widgets` package, write an analysis doc, create implementation tasks, and begin porting starting with log-viewer.

**Inferred user intent:** Build a repeatable process for integrating external React sketches into the themed widget framework, starting with a thorough analysis and proceeding incrementally with documentation.

### What I did

1. Explored the full project structure: `packages/engine`, `packages/desktop-os`, `apps/`, `imports/`
2. Read all 17 imported JSX files (11,057 lines total) to understand their structure
3. Read the engine's widget system: `parts.ts` (104 data-parts), `index.ts` (35+ widgets), `theming-and-widget-playbook.md`
4. Read the engine's CSS system: tokens, primitives, shell, theme overrides
5. Read the desktop-os store: `createLauncherStore.ts`, `appManifest.ts`
6. Read Storybook config: `.storybook/main.ts`, `.storybook/preview.ts`
7. Read existing widget implementations: `Btn.tsx`, `Checkbox.tsx`, `DataTable.tsx`, `ListView.tsx`, `TabControl.tsx`, `SelectableList.tsx`
8. Created docmgr ticket OS-07-ADD-RICH-WIDGETS with design doc, diary, and playbook
9. Wrote comprehensive analysis document mapping all imports to engine widgets
10. Created 24-task implementation plan across 7 phases

### Why

Need a clear map from imported inline-styled components to engine's data-part/token system before writing any code. The imports duplicate UI primitives extensively — understanding exactly what maps where prevents redundant work.

### What worked

- The theming-and-widget-playbook.md is exceptionally detailed and gave clear patterns for widget creation
- The `parts.ts` file makes it easy to see what data-parts already exist
- The engine widget index shows exactly what's available for composition

### What didn't work

- Initial directory exploration was misleading — `ls` on `desktop-os/src/` showed subdirectories that didn't exist (the `ls` output was from a different checkout state)
- Had to use `find` to get the actual file listing

### What I learned

**Key insight for playbook:** Before porting any widget, build a **primitive mapping table** that maps every inline-styled element in the import to either (a) an existing engine widget, (b) a CSS data-part that handles it, or (c) a "NEW" marker indicating a primitive that needs to be created. This table is the single most important artifact for planning the port.

**Pattern discovered across all 17 imports:**
- Every import reimplements: button, checkbox, window/titlebar, status bar
- Many reimplement: slider, radio button, search input, tooltip
- The reimplementations vary slightly (different padding, border-radius, shadow values) but are functionally identical
- The engine already has 80% of these primitives

**Architecture patterns in the imports:**
- All use `useState` for local state — no global state management
- Canvas-based widgets (oscilloscope, charts, logic-analyzer) use `useRef` + `requestAnimationFrame`
- Several implement their own drag handling (mactask, node-editor) — could share a `useDrag` hook
- Several implement their own keyboard navigation — could share patterns with engine's existing keyboard handling

### What was tricky to build

Nothing built yet — this was analysis only. The tricky part was understanding the full scope: 17 files, 11K lines, spread across multiple UI categories. The key challenge was systematically mapping each import's local primitives to engine equivalents without getting lost in the details.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- The decision to create a new `packages/rich-widgets` vs. adding to `packages/engine` — the boundary is "primitives vs. composites" but some new primitives (Sparkline, Slider) will live in the new package
- Whether canvas-based widgets should stay canvas or move to SVG for theme compatibility

### What should be done in the future

- Start Phase 1: create the package scaffolding
- Port LogViewer as reference implementation
- Extract reusable patterns into the playbook after the first widget is done

## Step 8: DeepResearch Widget Port (Phase 13)

### What was done
Ported `imports/deep-research-mac.jsx` (889 lines) → `packages/rich-widgets/src/deep-research/DeepResearch.tsx`.

**Files created:**
- `deep-research/types.ts` — ResearchStep union type (status | source | thinking | done), DepthLevel, DEPTH_LEVELS
- `deep-research/sampleData.ts` — DEMO_STEPS (14 research steps simulating a flow), generateReport()
- `deep-research/DeepResearch.tsx` — Main component + SourceCard + ProgressBar sub-components
- `deep-research/DeepResearch.stories.tsx` — 3 stories (Default, WithResults, Compact)
- `theme/deep-research.css` — 25 data-part rules, barberpole + blink animations

**Features:** Query input, depth selector (radio buttons), options (Checkbox from engine), research simulation with timed step progression, barberpole progress bar, source cards with index badges, thinking steps, final report display.

### Key decisions
- Radio buttons kept as custom elements (no engine Radio primitive) using `dr-radio` + `dr-radio-dot` data-parts
- Used engine `Checkbox` with `onChange={() => setState(v => !v)}` toggle pattern (lesson from LogicAnalyzer)
- Removed window chrome and internal themes — shell handles those
- Research simulation uses `setTimeout` chain to progressively reveal demo steps

### Verification
- TypeScript: clean (`pnpm tsc --noEmit`)
- Storybook: all 3 stories render correctly on port 6007
- Screenshot captured and verified

### Lessons learned
- The ResearchStep union type with discriminated `type` field makes step rendering clean via switch/case
- Barberpole progress bar animation reuses the same technique from the indeterminate progress pattern

## Step 9: GameFinder Widget Port (Phase 14)

### What was done
Ported `imports/gamefinder.jsx` (612 lines) → `packages/rich-widgets/src/game-finder/GameFinder.tsx`.

**Files created:**
- `game-finder/types.ts` — Game, Achievement, ArtType, GameFilter, GameSort, FILTER_OPTIONS, SORT_OPTIONS
- `game-finder/sampleData.ts` — SAMPLE_GAMES (8 classic Mac games with achievements)
- `game-finder/gameArt.ts` — drawGameArt() canvas-based pixel art for 8 game types
- `game-finder/GameFinder.tsx` — Main component + GameArt + StarRating + DownloadBar + GameDetail + GameRow
- `game-finder/GameFinder.stories.tsx` — 3 stories (Default, Compact, FewGames)
- `theme/game-finder.css` — ~60 data-part rules, launch animation

**Features:** Sidebar with navigation/filter/sort/profile stats, game list with canvas art thumbnails, detail view with hero, description, stats, achievements with progress, install/download simulation, launch overlay with progress animation, search.

### Key decisions
- Canvas pixel art kept as separate `gameArt.ts` utility for reuse
- Removed window chrome (MacWindow), menu bar, desktop background
- Used `Btn` from engine for Play/Back/Install buttons
- Radio buttons for sort kept as custom elements (same as DeepResearch)

### Verification
- TypeScript: clean
- Storybook: all 3 stories render correctly on port 6007
- Detail view verified by clicking Dark Castle — shows hero, achievements, stats

### Lessons learned
- Unicode escapes (`\u00B7`) in JSX text content render literally — must wrap in `{'\u00B7'}` expressions. This applies to all JSX text content between tags, NOT to string literals in `{}` expressions or JSX attributes.

### Code review instructions

- Review the analysis doc for completeness: `ttmp/.../design-doc/01-rich-widget-import-analysis-and-integration-plan.md`
- Verify the primitive mapping table accurately reflects engine capabilities
- Check that the task breakdown is reasonable and ordered correctly

### Technical details

**Engine widget count:** 35+ exported components from `packages/engine/src/components/widgets/index.ts`
**Engine data-parts:** 104 constants in `packages/engine/src/parts.ts`
**Engine themes:** base (default), classic, modern, macos1
**Import total:** 17 files, 11,057 lines
**Storybook:** Storybook 10.x with react-vite, configured at `.storybook/main.ts`
**Package manager:** pnpm with workspace protocol
